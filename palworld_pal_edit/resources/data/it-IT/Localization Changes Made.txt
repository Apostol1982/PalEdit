Changes made

File: passives.json

- Conceited description changed from defense -20% to defense -10% (probably a typo)

- Sadist description changed from defense +15% to defense -15% (probably a typo)

- Mentally unstable translated as "Instabile" (literally unstable) as in game it shows "it_Text" (The unstable passive has a different name in italian, Irrequietezza, literally restlessness)


File: ui.json

- Since I don't know what these do:
Preset changes attributes
Preset changes rank
Preset changes level 
I've translated them as "I preset cambiano attributi/rango/livello" which is literally "The preset modifies the attributes/rank/level". I don't know if that is right


File: pals.json

- Weaponsdealer and Questman are just "it_Text" in the localized datatables, so I've translated them. The translation are quite literal but I don't know if they'll change in future updates.

- Male_Trader01 shady pal merchant in italian is localized as Villager (Abitante del villaggio) for some reason, I don't know if it's right (found him once but don't remember it's in game name).

- Doctor is also localized as Villager, I don't know whether that's right or not.

File: attack.json

- I haven't found Seigetsu blade II in the game files, so I translated it like Seigetsu Blade with II after (like the two Divine Disasters).

- The following moves have been translated by me since it's just "it_Text in he game files":
Intimidate
Triple cannon
Tidal wave
Throw
Scratch
Work attack
Snow storm
Dark tornado
Water balloon
Grasstyphoon
Seed shotgun
The translations are literal.
